I use these in everyday things from remotes, to flash lights. They work just as good as the more expensive batteries saving me lots of cash.I turn to the AmazonBasics brand when it comes to all of my office needs. I can't complain about any of their products I bought so far. Now it's time to buy a big pack of AAA batteries from AmazonBasics. I highly recommend these batteries to anyone out there looking to buy a great quality pack of batteries. These are great for products that have a highly running life like babies products or toys. They defiantly can keep up with my family without wasting ton of money."

      "reviews.text": "AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

The expiration date on these Amazon basics AAA's is 2027 so I expect them to have a good shelf life I believe these batteries will perform every bit as well as the energizers I last purchased. I took advantage of the snail mail delivery I received a 5 Amazon credit which made this deal even better.

Plus , I stocked up for all those dang Christmas toys for my triplets. If I buy one, I have to buy three!!!!They lasted just as long as a standard battery . Plus , I love that they come in a nice cardboard sleeve. Rather than the ones at the store where they all fall out when you rip the plastic from the cardboard.To wrap up- these were very impressive."

Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below.

I came across these while searching for batteries to use with my son's toys (they all take a ton) as well as for use in products around the house. I took a look at the reviews and decided they were definitely worth trying out! Of course I used my Prime shipping and they arrived in 2 days. Once they arrived we put 3 in my son's toy train and BAM! off it took with speed! Even my son said wow, the train is going faster than ever haha! I'm currently using these in his toys, the wall clock, the meat thermometer and many other items! I certainly recommend these batteries. They came packaged nicely in groups of 4, tucked into a cute little cardboard box. At a fraction of the cost of the big name batteries and they work JUST AS WELL if not BETTER!"

Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."

It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me.

I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."

They last just as long as the ones you'd buy at big box store, but cost so much less. I haven't used any yet that seemed to die long before they should have.The batteries come in a slim cardboard box which is easy for storing. My only complaint is that they are plastic wrapped in sets of 4 inside the cardboard. While this does make it easy if I have to grab some to take with me, it seems a tad environmentally unfriendly and the plastic is tightly wrapped, making it hard to open."

We put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. Put them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaver, which the other brands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Got the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Store brands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basics AA batteries EASY OPEN packaging is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packaging and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are."

      "reviews.text": "Why pay extra for Duracell batteries when AmazonBasics' batteries will last almost as long I bought a 48-pack of AA batteries for just 12 that's just 25 cents per battery! Meanwhile, Energizer Max was being sold at 14 for a 24-pack, coming out to 58 cents per battery and Duracell Coppertop was being sold at 12 for a 24-pack, coming out to 50 cents per battery. Amazon has proved the quality of its items over and over again, but I'd say they really outdid themselves this time. Ask anyone which battery brand is the best and most will answer Duracell, while some others may answer Energizer. That's because both companies, particularly Duracell, have built a solid, positive reputation as long lasting batteries, and not only do they last long, but they also survive a long period of time being stored. Some Duracell batteries even state that they'll last 10 years without being used, of which I have no doubt if any battery can last that long, it's Duracell. Nonetheless, Amazon has also created a battery that outshines most, and in most applications even outshines Duracell and Energizer. AmazonBasics batteries last a long time before having to be replaced and they come at a cheaper price than what you'll find in the dollar store, plus they look pretty cool. Obviously that last part isn't important, but it's nice to have a unique-looking battery that can be easily distinguished from all others. AmazonBasics also claims that their batteries have anti-leakage protection and can be stored for up to 10 years, just like Duracell. All three brands offer anti-leakage batteries, AmazonBasics and Duracell batteries are said to last up to 10 years in storage, and Energizer offers batteries that last up to 20 years in storage. If you want to store batteries for a decade or two, your best bet is Energizer Ultimate Lithium. If you are using batteries for important applications such as smoke detectors, although I suspect that AmazonBasics would fulfill its job, maybe stick with Duracell just because it has already proven over a long period of time the quality and consistency of its products, while AmazonBasics is still creating its name. But for pretty much everything else, from remote controls to cameras to calculators and everything similar, AmazonBasics should be your only thought when it comes to buying batteries.Here are links for what I believe are each brand's best batteries:AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries (48-Pack)Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA Batteries, World's Highest-Energy AA Battery, 8 countDuracell Ultra Power Aa Batteries 8 Count"

Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."

I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia.

      "reviews.text": "Package of batteries came in Amazon shipping box measuring 13 x 9.75 x 3 . Inside that box with bubble wrap was a smaller cardboard box measuring 5.75 x 6.128 x .75. The batteries came in two cellophane wraps, 20 batteries in all 10 per wrapper.The AAA batteries measure 10.22mm in diameter and 44.22mm in length. Battery imprinted with Amazon basis. The battery is mostly silver accented with a green circle with a check mark inside. One of the ends of the battery has a little protruding button and is marked with a + sign. The other side of the battery is flat and marked with a minus sign. There are several descriptions and warnings printed on the battery. One of the messages with a black background states No mercury added with a note below that says Made in Indonesia with some more writing that looks like French. Also printed on the battery is a note reading ALKALINE BATTERY and below this, AAA/LR03/AM4 followed by 1.5V. There is some Chinese symbols as well. Another warning reads- May explode or leak if recharged, disposed of in fire, short circuited, or improperly inserted. Again this is followed with French writing. Also there are other warning labels, one with a small circle that has a line thru it, a small picture of a garbage can with a line thru it, and another small circle with arrows around a E.The battery fits in my small flashlight and powers up ok, but has not been in there long enough to test the longevity of the battery. Seems like a good value per battery if they last a while. I would purchase these again if they prove to last a reasonable time."

Packaging is very simple to get open, and since ordering the first pack, I've yet to replace a single one. I'd wager they will last just as along as name-brand ones we'd been purchasing for years.

Usually its the remote control, and I either borrow batteries from a different device, or switch the batteries around in the remote(which I may add does work very short term, but it does work!) When I saw these on Amazon I couldn't pass them up. We bought these in October, which was super helpful around Christmas. They come in a nice sturdy box, which is where I store them. They are packages in groups of four. They have lasted a while, and I have had no issues.I paid around 11 then and I just noticed that they are slightly cheaper with Subscribe and Save so needless to say I will be picking up another box.

I was just digging through the junk draw when I realized I was completely out of both AAA and AA batteries. Amazon to the rescue. Two minutes later batteries ordered and on the way. Almost everything I normally use on a daily basis (or remember using) has built in rechargeable batteries, that is until I start thinking about remotes and game controllers, the little things that are just apart of my life without actually being memorable. Well that is while they work, I remember them when they don't work. This pack of batteries last me about a year (I think, just a guess) which is perfect. I tore the top of the box and threw the entire container in the front of my junk draw. I like how the container is just cardboard, not horrible formed plastic like the last pack of batteries I had. They are also separated into three vertical partitions of 4 sets of 4 batteries wrapped in plastic. Some may find this inconvenient with the extra steps of removing the extra wrapping. I like it, I usually need batteries in pairs of 2 or groups of 4, so i can just quickly unwrap a pack and go to town. This also makes it easier to clean up if I drop the box."

I can say that in high use devices such as flashlights, they do drain faster than Duracell. However when compared to the cost, you will still come out ahead with these, at least when buying in bulk.In addition I found that Duracell batteries gave me 4 weeks with the candles I own while Rayovac gave me 3 weeks. These Amazon batteries give me 6 weeks. So they are not only a better price but longer lasting as far as slow power drain devices.I have been using these batteries now for a great deal of time and with applicable use not pretty but utterly useless conjecture. Numbers and potential usage reports look all fine and dandy but are nothing compared to having purchased and used at least half a thousand of them. I love em. They work great in my nearly 100 electric candles."

I marked off one star because I don't believe they have lasted as long as the Energizer batteries I used previously, but it is not a big difference. I have been using these primarily to power a head lamp with band that I wear at work at night time out in the field. They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."

I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries."

The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the timer to 8 hours on each. After 25 days I had my first failure. The Rayovac candle didn't turn on. At day 26 the Maxell battery failed. and at day 27 the EverReady failed to turn on my candle. Along came day 27 - five hours into the 8 hour set timer and the AmazonBasics didn't make my candle work. I know this isn't a 'scientific' test but satisfied me as to which battery I will be buying from now on and those friends and family will now also be buying AmazonBasic Performance Alkaline Batteries."

      "reviews.text": "This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."

First off the price was definitely better than buying even store brand batteries at a local store. It was definitely cheaper than buying brand name. I was really impressed with how they were packaged. They come in a nice little box with four batteries plastic wrapped together. I like that because the batteries stay nice and organized even once you open the package. The single packages inside are easy to open too. You just twist them and they break open so it's not like you have to grab scissors or a knife.As far as using them they work just fine. I'm no scientist so I've never sat down and done some experiment on these to track the use, but I can't tell the difference from when I was buying Duracell or Energizer or any other battery.We have used them in all kinds of kids toys, in remote controls and in our Xbox 360 controller. They seem to hold up well and I have not had any that did not work.Since I can't tell a difference in how they work or how long they last I will definitely get these since they are cheaper. And I like the packaging much better since I don't end up with batteries rolling all over our drawer where we keep them. Highly recommended!"

      "reviews.text": "I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."

      "reviews.text": "Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined."

The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."

They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load."

      "reviews.text": "I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. No joy. I cleaned the contacts, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Just for grins, I installed into one candle three Ray-O-Vac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the Ray-O-Vacs, installed the Amazons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the Ray-O-Vacs, none with the Amazons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a Ray-O-Vac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a tad longer on the Ray-O-Vac (see picture). The Ray-O-Vac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Amazons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solidly built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerance (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheapo device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer cables (among their first products in the Basics line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connectors and cables line (that being dog house-training piddle pads, which have not proven as absorbent as similarly-priced products, and I've bought a lot of different brands). The batteries were my second foray into Basics product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-cables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too."

They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them.

      "reviews.text": "I purchased AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. This pack has lasted awhile."

My household ends up going through AA batteries like there is no tomorrow! So when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the wii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. So far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!"

I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."

It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought.

      "reviews.text": "I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."

Bottom line: A good mix of quality / quantity. They aren't your cheapest, junkiest battery but they also don't compare to the best AAA's, Energizer Lithiums. Mid-grade at a great price.

I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."

      "reviews.text": "I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"

Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful.

My use in in a keyboard, several remote controls (including Fire TV and Echo remotes), and some radio linked thermometers I bought last century but still work great. I'm sure I use them other places I've forgotten.Do they last as long as Duracell Ultra or whatever super-duper alkaline I might have gotten in the past If they don't, it's not such that I've noticed and that's good enough for me. I'm not into battery performance enough to run tests keep records! If you are, spend more money on famous brand name batteries!What I got was a simple cardboard box with 36 cells group in fours with plastic around each four. A lot like other batteries I've purchased in the last couple of years. No packaging drama and that's nice.The AmazonBasicis AAA batteries perform well enough to satisfy me, are inexpensive, and just fit and work wherever I need AAA cells. Just the basics and that's just what I want. When I get what I want I give 5 stars.Hope this helps someone."
