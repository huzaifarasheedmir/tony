If not, then I would just stick with the Voyage (if you're a hardcore reader) or a Paperwhite for casual readers."

      "reviews.text": "I was used to the Kindle 3rd gen(Kindle Keyboard) and when i first held the Oasis it felt very odd and uncomfortable and the metal back made it feel like it could slip and fall at any second. It does take time to get used to. The device is expensive for something that is not even a colored screen. However, my main reason was because it was a bigger screen and clearer ( besides there doesn't seem to be much upgrades between the Kindle Keyboard and the other ones) I find myself accidently touching the touchscreen more often than I would like ( but much less than when I 1st got it- a week or so ago). All in all it is a sleek and nice device, alittle pricey."

And all the three; paperwhite, voyage and oasis 2017 are fantastic devices but the only two reasons i upgraded are bigger screen and waterproof. Though the screen size is little bigger than the previous models it does make quite a difference. Also oasis comes with 8gb or 32gb of memory. But otherwise i love paperwhite and voyage as well."

      "reviews.text": "I've always been a fan of the Kindle, ever since the first one came out over a decade again.I was excited about this Kindle due to the many premium features it showed - the all-metal finish, high-resolution ePaper display, backlighting, extended battery life, etc.I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact that this only supports wifi (not cellular or WhisperSync) makes it even more of a drawback and something I would not recommend to a friend - stick with the cheaper version.I also found annoying problems trying to get my Apple Airpod earphones to work with this device. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I found that I had to go through the entire pairing process again; they were not automatically connected and synced the moment I had both devices turned on."
