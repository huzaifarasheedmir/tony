      "reviews.text": "I already have the Amazon Echo so this was just an additional one for my office. I think these gadgets are great. Set alarms, timers, get your local weather and who won the game last night. It can do too many things for me to list. It's great for everything however not great for music. I do listen to my local radio station on it - but compared to its' BIGGER brother Echo the sound is not that good."
