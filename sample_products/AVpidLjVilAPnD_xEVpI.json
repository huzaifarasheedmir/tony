There are several offline options to load files onto the SD card, or to your tablets memory, so you can watch movies or use it as a mp3 player while away from internet. I watched a 2 hour movie on the airplane and only went through 30% of the battery power. Beautiful screen, loud speakers with the option for headphones. I have no reason to want anything more expensive, such as an ipad or surface since this does all I need while away from home."

      "reviews.text": "I love this kindle! I had one of the first Fire HD kindles that is still kicking and awesome, but when I saw this in the store I just had to have it. I think it's more user friendly and feels like it offers so many more options and functions than the Fire HD I have. Not to mention it dwarfs my last kindle in size. If I had to make one complaint, it's that there is not an \"auto brightness\" function (or at least I haven't found it) and you can't make your pages a cream color rather than stark white. Both those options were easier on my eyes, but I am testing out the Blue Shade mode to see if that helps as much as it's supposed to with night time/ bed time reading. All in all, I am extremely happy with this purchase."
