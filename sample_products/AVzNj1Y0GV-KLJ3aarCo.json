      "reviews.text": "I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before."

      "reviews.text": "I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9\u201a\u00c4\u00f9) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t spent much time browsing the web on it since that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not what I bought it for. So I can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty solid on its own."

      "reviews.text": "Bought it for my kids. Never bought Amazon tablets before because Youtube kids is a must have. However, installing Google Playstore, framework and services was surprisingly easy and from there was just easy. There was an excellent list of games and entertainment on Amazon store and integration with my Prime account was extremely simple. Price point for the performance and quality of this tablet $49.99 8\" 16GB & $79.99 32GB) against most other ordinary name tablets which are $100+ is outstanding. Presence of ads and other material really isn't a problem and well worth the discount I'm very happy."

I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty."

      "reviews.text": "My wife's Ipad Mini had issues, she wore it flat out, and wanted to get another one but did not want to spend the money on a new iPad, so we gave this one a try. After BB Reward Zone $ I got it for about $100ish with 32gb of memory.To be clear, this is not on the same level as the iPad mini but it was not designed to. Technical specs not quite as good but for $100ish dollars from a reputable company it is not bad at all. The first thing to note is that it does not come with the ability to download from the Google Play Store. You can can get around this by side loading Google and there are plenty of websites to tell you how to this very easily.My wife has been burning it up with this tablet and she really likes it. She can let go of some of the shortcomings vs the iPad mini. Overall she likes it, which is good.So if you are wanting an inexpensive tablet from reliable company, try the Fire tablet."

It comes on a little slower than I would like, but it is a great buy for me. Once it comes on it is very fast."

      "reviews.text": "First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!"
