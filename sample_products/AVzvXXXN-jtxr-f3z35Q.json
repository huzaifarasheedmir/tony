      "reviews.text": "We have several echoes and dots throughout our house, we use it to listen to music, check the weather, traffic, adjust settings on our smart home devices, create shopping lists, use it as a kitchen timer, check facts, use as an intercom, phone family, as a bedside alarm, listen to music throughout the house, and the list just goes on and on. It really is a personal assistant, new skills are appearing every day and It's fun finding new things she can do and answer. Ever expanding knowledge base and skills are the biggest feature, not likely to become obsolete very soon ....."

The Echo has been the most helpful in our home for creating shopping lists for everyone in the house with a phone. If any of us find ourselves at the store, we know what the others want. Shopping on Amazon is really easy and fun as well. There's a whole bunch of apps so it won't be hard for you to find what will make the Echo useful to you specifically. We love it. I couldn't recommend it more."

It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!"

      "reviews.text": "I own two echos and 1 amazon firetv. Alexa is on all. Echo is great if.... you DO subscribe to Amazon Prime Membership and get the free music that comes with it. (Prime comes with 250 song limit) I also have added the extra 250,000 songs for 29 and now have uploaded over 13,000 songs of my own. I don't need to listen to the music I can't stand! 50's 60's some 70's and 80's are what I want and instrumentals Mantovani, 101 strings, Paul Mauriat, Herb Alpert, etc sound great on it.Just have to say: Alexa, shuffle Neil Diamond, Alexa, shuffle Petula Clark, Alexa, play Sound of Music, Alexa, what is the temperature. Alexa, score Cubs etc. You get the idea. You can set multiple alarms up to 24 hours in advance, You can ask for Motels and Hotels around Dubuque, IA. How many days till Christmas (or any date you ask for). I fall to sleep every night with Alexa, play Streams and Birds. She will then play a water stream with birds singing. or whatever you want to hear such as rainforest, thunder and rain, frogs along the Mississippi, etc. They ARE part of my life now. I sit outside and listen to whatever type of music I'm in the mood for. It must have a WIFI connection to be used, and some type of pad, Kindle fire, ipad, phones, etc. to set it up to your (or anyones) WIFI. You must download the Alexa App (free on Amazon), to set it up with your home location, and your WIFI. If you unplug it from one outlet in your home and want to take it outside, as long as it can still get WIFI, all you have to do is plug it in and it will find your wifi again. I just can't say enough about how I like it and it WILL be getting a lot better as they are still upgrading them.Read full review..."

      "reviews.text": "I like the amazon echo, but it needs more improvements. It does not understand many things you ask. it does not connect to all my wemo devices however, it is good at what it does. the sound quality is the best it offers. I like the local weather and 7 day weather and news. With my amazon prime, my music is played and sounds great. Some might say it is too high a price to pay, however i bought it for 150.00 barely used and glad i purchased it."

I highly recommend the 1st generation Alexa as it is the best sounding of them all. I have also purchased the newer one and the quality of sound was not near the Alexa 1st generation. I am now purchasing for Christmas gifts. Grab the 1st generation Alexa while you can before you can no longer get them. Sounds great, ease of use extremely easy and connection with great ease."

      "reviews.text": "It has a surprisingly quick response to the queries that it does recognize. I found its necessary to be rather specific in the way commands are phrased. Also a good bit of set up is involved, including subscription and agreeing to terms and conditions that nobody ever reads. And even then, it seems copyright laws limit the echo.I would like to be able to promt a command with something I choose as apposed to saying Alexa every time. It seems with something so adaptable, this would be easy to make available. Perhaps it is and I simply haven't found how yet.All around fun device, with good quality sound. And with the purchase of the battery adapter base, it's portable to wherever Wi-Fi is available.Thousands of apps skills are available for the echo. Virtually endless fun."

I can't wait for the Echo to add flight arrival and departure information (all transportation info in general), cooking recipes, and generally have all the information of Wikipedia.... now that would be great! It's a good start, but has a ways to go.Owen"
