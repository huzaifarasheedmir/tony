I would not recommend to someone who is looking for good product. I cost is the factor you can live with it."

I have been wanting to get one for a couple years but never had any wifi to use it with all the features, and trust me i bought every other kids tablet there was along the way. My daughter will be 6 this year and this is easily her 10th tablet i got all the ones for kids with the pre loaded apps and learning games. From nabi to samsung kids tablets and everything in between. These are by far the best. Very easy to use and my daughter loves all the games on them she plays for hours and the battery lasts a long time too, all the other tablets battery would die after an hour! This one just keeps going! Even my 2 year old son cant get enough of the books and learning games. I also like that it comes with a free year of free time for kids and if it breaks for any reason within 2 years they will replace it. All the other tablets broke after only a year or less, just stop working or glitch out. Trust me this tablet us worth it! Give it a try! You wont be sorry."

      "reviews.text": "The Kindle Fire HD 8 edition is just like the adult version except it comes withOUT the special offers (ads). It also includes a two-year warranty, one year of FreeTime, a protective case, and can be bought locally at Target. PIN protected accounts can be set up for adults and children. The Kindle Fire is designed to consume content including accessing Amazon services and content. A library of apps, books, music, videos, and more is available at your fingertips! For the kids, content is appropriate for their age level and screen time can be set. It just works! If you want more than that, the additional desired options do not just work out of the box. I am an older, non-traditional college student with children and some difficulty seeing. I prefer to buy my textbooks or check out books from the local library in the Kindle Edition. There are a lot of advantages to eBooks including being able to enlarge the font, multi-media elements, built-in dictionary, ability to extract notes, and some have text-to-speech. There are also no books to return or mail back. The Kindle Edition format works better with the actual reader instead of just the apps on an iPad, iPhone, or even computer--I have all these too. I need to be able to create content too and apps that may not be available through Amazon app store. A quick web search led me to instructions to install the four necessary files to have Google Play on this device (software version 5.6.1.0) with no root needed from a reputable source. I was now able to add the Microsoft Office apps, YouTube, VLC, a virus scanner, and some other favorites through the Google Play app. The SD card can be used for movies or music too for on the go where access to Wi-Fi may not be available. This part was easy. These apps can be copied over to the children's profiles too. It was a bit more complicated to do this because of the number of steps involved, and it takes a little more time and patience. Bluetooth allowed me to connect a keyboard (can add separately or buy a case/keyboard combo like one made by Fintie named Blade X1) and a mouse too turning it into a lightweight, inexpensive, functional, and portable device great for classes or on the go at a fraction of the cost for the least expensive iPad with a case and keyboard. It is no powerhouse tablet though. However, it does work much better than my under-powered netbooks that run Windows. I only installed the essentials and close the apps I am not using. Unless your child is responsible and careful, I think the charging of the device by an adult would eliminate many of the issues I have seen about it."

I can also time the tablet for them since I don't want them stuck on the tablet all day. It's just like a regular tablet with YouTube and Web . Except it's so much easier for kids to use ! And comes with a kid friendly case ! Think of it like a cellphone that you let your kids borrow while you get things done around the house , except kids probably click on something else by accident and takes them to an ad which kids hate and mostly throw the phone to the floor . Well this tablet shows the apps, movies and books making it easier for kids to handle without worrying about them clicking something else by accident .It also blocks ads from the applications/games and doesn't let them click on tokens you can purchase with debit card etc.. This has such great quality videos! Very fast and a great amount of volume !!! I love this tablet and recommend it to anyone that has kids !!!"

But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!"

A word of advice: Fire OS is very limited, but with a few downloads you can easily bypass the fire OS launcher and even install google services. Battery life is very good, and with the included case now I'm not afraid of another accidental drop. It can handle any of his kids games and with both the Amazon app store AND the play store the possibilities are endless."

      "reviews.text": "We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing.

      "reviews.text": "Got this tablet to replace the nabi my 4 yr old daughter had. I picked this tablet because of its 2 yr no questions asked return policy, If u have kids you know they always find away to break spill or the software glitches. So far this tablet works great it's way faster then the nabi was its easy for my 4 yr old to work and I can set time limits and what she can do it also shows me what she uses and for how long each day. The tablet is light and easy for her to hold and the bumper has worked good when it has been dropped. Has a great selection of free apps books and games for a full year after that its $4.99 a month. My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet"

She could not wait for the tablet to charge. She kept asking if the tablet was ready to turn on. When the tablet finally charged, she could not put it down. She went from room to room showing her brothers what she could do with her tablet. Everybody wanted to do something with her tablet. As a parent, I just love the rubber bumper. The rubber bumper around the tablet is an excellent bonus to the tablet. It helps protect the tablet if it drops or falls accidentally. We all know how little hands sometimes drops things more than once. I only wish we could have bought this tablet much sooner. Being a first grader this year, my granddaughter can really benefit while using this tablet. Also, there are many educational opportunities for young children to engage themselves in instead of being glued to the television on a daily basis. This tablet is more child-centered and parental controlled."

Nowe originally she had the 7 generation one and it was only 16 G and it ran out of battery in like 4.5 hours. The 8 generation 32 G allows ny 2 year old to download plenty but with parental controls I customized myself and for a long day at the RMV or doctor office or a drive 3vstates away, even if she takes a break I don't have to recharge it for more like 9 hours. This is with downloading and watching movies and full episodes if all her favorite b shows. Also she's crazy abusive with it and it functions perfectly. My 4 year old ha's it too and his preschool teachers are begging me to tell them how he's so quick to learn almost everything they put in front of him and his vocabulary has significantly improved as well. I'm so happy with it I'm going to buy one for myself as well as a back up incase one is stolen. Only issue is the kids get addicted so it's real important to b set the timer to shut the system down so they remember to take potty breaks and play outside, but other than that I am thrilled with this product"

Aside from the awesome drop-proof case, it has a nicely done custom kids view that removes all the things I don't want my daughter having access to (Youtube, the Google play store, web browsing). I already had one issue with it (99% certain it was my fault) but Amazon's \"Worry Free Guarantee\" had me a replacement tablet in 2 days for zero cost and no questions asked.
