It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens."

      "reviews.text": "I needed a reasonable laptop bag and got this.On arrival I put my dell Inspiron laptop inside and the charger went in the front pocket. Inside the laptop slips in the middle then your are able to put a ipad and maybe a diary either side. As there is a slide pocket each side of the laptop.It's actually well made surprisingly and the handles on top are nice and comfortable to use/hold.The strap that goes over the should is nice, maybe could of had more padding on the shoulder strap.The reason for 4 stars is that I think the case should have more padding to protect your electrical device.It's a very nice bag and I do recommend it and for the price it is great."
