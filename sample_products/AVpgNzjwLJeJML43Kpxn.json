      "reviews.text": "AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"

      "reviews.text": "I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them."

They arrived packaged well and wrapped nicely, see included pictures for details. I like to keep extra batteries around because most new electronics do not have included batteries these days. I hate getting a device in the mail and scavenging the house for batteries or stealing them from the remote controls. At this price, we can all afford to keep a bunch on hand. Ive tested these on several devices so far and they appear to be comparable to brand name batteries, they last a long time and bring all my electronics to life with renewed vigor. I'll definitely be buying more in the future."

The pump uses 4 AA batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are packaged. Having them bundled in foursomes is convenient. My pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more AA batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if AA batteries are needed."

These Amazon alkaline batteries are advertised as having 10 years shelf life, and after receiving them I confirmed that on each battery is printed the expiration year 2025, which is what I expected having bought them in 2015.Now I won't have to by ordinary batteries that end up discharging internally in just a few years.

Instead, I'm going to talk about the quality of Amazon's Basics line of batteries and whether or not they're worth your money. My son is six years-old and owns a ton of toys that require batteries. I can say, without-a-doubt, that we have tried every brand of battery out there. Time and time again we keep coming back to the AmazonBasics AA Performance batteries. They have a long shelf life, retain their charge, and as far as I can tell they last just as long as any other battery on the market. The biggest difference is in price. Where else are you going to get 48 quality AA batteries for 11 Just buy them! You won't regret it."

It's sad when the batteries cost more than the thing you are putting them into. I paid about the same amount to get 48... Yes 48 AA batteries from Amazon as I would have paid to get 8 from my local retailer. I needed batteries for my new game trail camera. It takes 8 AA batteries and I was fearful that I was going to go into the poor house trying to keep fresh batteries in my trail camera. I went shopping online at Amazon and found these. I bought these several weeks ago. I used 8 AA from this box in my new trail camera. I am so happy with them. My trail camera has been in the woods several weeks and the batteries are still over 90 charged and that's after taking tons of video of game. These are working great and I saved a ton of cash. I am buying a box of the AAA now. I always seem to need them around the house for some reason. I am very happy with my new batteries from AmazonBasics. They are working great for me.

No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."

I'm not sure about shelf life though as I never put aside a battery for that many years and tried it before, but I do believe these can last way longer than the other brands. From experience, I feel that these out last longer than others with normal usage. The shiny coating looks better than the white coat before. The price for a pack of these is also the best value than going to any actual store to buy them as they tend to be expensive. So far, every one of these batteries worked just fine with full charges and no dead ones at all. Very satisfied and happy I made this purchase."

Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them. In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last. Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money."

And the subscribe and save option is awesome when you have kids in the house - gadgets and remotes and games and controllers and toys, oh my! This keeps you ready and stocked.I also like the way they're packaged - plastic wrap is easy to tear off, but holds together sets of 4, all boxed together. Very handy.These are a must for any busy, budget-conscious parent!"

And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!! The batteries are in bundles of 4. When we get low, I'll just order another box. Best way to always keep batteries available for controllers, remotes, and such."

Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them.

Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!"

We've found that they work best in computer accessories like a keyboard or mouse but do not last long in things like toy remote controlled cars. Anything that takes a big drain in short bursts off of them (like electric toy car motors) shortens the life of these batteries fast but things that only use a small amount of energy over a long period of time do a lot better. Some name brand batteries do very well with high drain electronics and last a lot longer than these but if you use these Amazon batteries on low draw electronics you'll get your money's worth.What I've found them good for: Keyboard, mouse, laser pointer, small LED flashlights, small noise making toys (plays music, electronic beeps)Not good for: Anything with an electric motor, toy cars, pencil sharpener, etc...They can be a good value depending on what you use them to power."

It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!"

      "reviews.text": "These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."

That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price.

These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. This means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular negative (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Makes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!"

The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands)."

I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opener. So, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the leastI was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basics batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name brands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name brands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. This is an ideal combination in my opinion."

      "reviews.text": "With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now."

We mostly bought them for my toddler's toys and they work well enough for that!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!"

Pull the Duracells out, and put in Everyready Alkaline Energizer, and you won't notice any difference in performance. Fifty years ago, freshness was a big factor, but alkaline has a long shelf life. These alkaline AAs are indistinguishable from most brands.In a way, that's a shame. The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume. The 4-packs are in a corrugated cardboard box that looks llike it will last long enough for the purpose.These are enougfh batteries here to last me a long while. I'll be needing AAA batteries soon, though, so I'll order them in a month or two."

I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia.

We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future."

      "reviews.text": "So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Caveat Emptor) seems to be the bottom line."

If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months)."

It helps me save a lot of money and avoid the trouble of running to the shop every time I need batteries. What I liked most about is its packaged! It comes in a card box that can be open/closed and in it the batteries are packaged with a wrapper in a group of 4. That makes it easy to find a group of batteries in my drawer. I am happy with the product and will probably order more when it run out."

They provide the same brightness as the energizers but my light seemed to start getting dimmer a little sooner than with the energizers. There is not a big enough difference however to justify the price of energizers, therefore I will continue to purchase the AmazonBasics batteries for sure."

I am one of those types who uses a volt meter to test batteries prior to installation and often when I remove them I test them to see what is left at the end of its useful life. Duracell batteries are usually a good bit higher in their new state then any other battery I have used on average. They also seem to go for longer life cycles then any other battery and go lower as far as discharge voltage goes. These batteries are the first and only ones that seem to be close to Duracell. These are a better deal as far as price per unit goes. The difference in performance is not enough to pay more for Duracell batteries."

It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great! With AA and AAA size I'd recommend buying a bigger pack- yes it does seem like a lot of batteries at first but trust me you'll be glad you got extra- it's one of those items every house needs and easily gets overlooked."

His controllers for his game systems require batteries and we go through many so far he has been using the same Amazon batteries for a week and the controller charger has not even gone down its still at full charge pretty impressive!! We notice the batteries we have been using get drained pretty quickly! Overall very happy with the purchase!! I think these will suit just fine for lots of toys!!"

They have a decent weight to them. This is generally how you can tell the difference between cheap batteries and high-quality batteries. The heavier they are the liner they will last.After using these batteries for a Nerf battle birthday party to power large Nerf guns and throughout Christmas, I'm hooked. I have enrolled in a Subscribe and Save plan on Amazon which allows for an additional discount to have them delivered periodically.I would definitely recommend these batteries to anyone for whatever battery needs they may have. They are high- quality, inexpensive, Amazon.com backed batteries. There really isn't much of a risk."

I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. This is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are generic and have not worked as well but I am here to vouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlasted the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was floored by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. As it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, AA, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries. They do not disappoint!"

I've done this for several years, I usually change the batteries out about every 6 weeks, these lasted about 7 weeks.

      "reviews.text": "Until lately 99 of the AA and AAA batteries I bought were Duracell brand. Its not that Ive found any brand to be that much better or that much worse than another but I tend to stick with what works for me. And for those things that I use disposable batteries in (I try to use rechargeables whenever I can) Duracells seem to work out the best. And they are the brand that the membership store sells so I can get them at a reasonable price whenever Im shopping for supplies.I took a chance on buying Amazon Basics brand for a couple of reasons. One is that Ive had good luck with the Amazon Basics brand I dont think Amazon is going to mess up their reputation selling junk. One strong factor is that these claim to be made in Japan, and Japanese-made batteries from Panasonic, Sony, Maxell and other major name brands have a good reputation. But the 1 reason I tried these is price. They are 10-15 cents less PER BATTERY than what Ive been buying and it doesnt make sense to me to pay more if Im not getting any more.These have an overall feeling and look of being made pretty well. Its easy to spot a cheap no-name battery and these are definitely better. They are bulk packed, which is great, why pay more for fancy packaging on something as mundane as a battery And theyre fresh you know thats going to be true with Amazons immense daily turnover of product. If you are reading the reviews, be aware that Amazon has been making regular upgrades to this battery, so something reviewed a year ago is probably long obsolete by now. The biggest change I understand is the shelf life of the newest formulation is now rated at 10 years. I dont really care, theres no way a box of batteries is going to sit on my shelf for 10 years but it does mean that when I get to the 48th battery out of a package of 48 it probably will be nearly as fresh as the first one in the pack.I havent been able to see any downsides, and I do like saving money that would be wasted for fancy packaging and expensive advertising, so unless something drastically changes I believe these will now be my brand of choice."

I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."

      "reviews.text": "A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."

You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair."

C is a size only a few of my devices use. One is a lantern and the other is an electronic pest deterrent that I have to keep the deer away from my growing trees. I have always purchased the big two name brands in batteries and I always make sure to buy Alkaline batteries. My love for Amazon and their AmazonBasics products brought me to these and with the Amazon pricing and quality, I figured I couldn't go wrong.These batteries come in easy to open packaging and have the same shelf life as competing brands. I bet that one of those two brands makes these batteries for Amazon and simply private labels their name on them, as the quality is obviously there. I see no difference in longevity, shelf life, size or quality. If you're looking to save a few bucks but still have a top performing battery, look no further than AmazonBascis alkaline batteries. I hope you found my review helpful!My reviews are my opinions of the product received and just my opinion. Everyone is different and could have a different opinion of a product. I do not receive any monetary payment for my reviews, and I always keep them honest. So no need to worry whether or not my review is genuine, because it is.

I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package."

Not to mention, I have 2 controllers (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. This means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gaming or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backups. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often."

Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!"

While the non-rechargeable batteries do not measure in mAh, these Amazon Basic ones are very much comparable in every way. I found this to be extremely interesting since I have yet to see non-rechargeable batteries perform so well. Then I researched into this and found that they are made in Japan - the same place that the original Eneloop and Fujitsu batteries are made which are where the top notch AA or AAA batteries ever made."

It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good."

In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries."

I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"

I *love* that about amazon.the batteries were in a plain box, wrapped in four packs. I often buy amazonbasics, both for the quality and the simple, clean packaging. I use a lot of aa batteries in items that do not work with my rechargeables. I don't mind finding space for 48. in fact the box of 48 requires just a little more space than a 20-24 pack of other batteries since other batteries use more packaging.put these in your wish list or save for later in your cart and watch for a great price to buy them."

They are definitely comparable to the leading brands out there. They are also much more affordable. We have used them in everyday items that need batteries. We mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries.

      "reviews.text": "I am not a bettery expert nor an electrician. There are a few things that I consider when shopping for a battery - shelf life, price and brand. When you buy a brand product, you are most certainly guaranteed a good long lasting battery. Hence I always bought energizer or Duracell. Amazon is also a big brand so I decided to give it a try and to be honest with you it's a great battery. Price wise, it's cheaper than other name brands. One other andvreallyninportant factor is the shelf life. This battery has a shelf life of ten years, while a lot of batteries have 5 year shelf life. This is important for someone who uses batteries on a less frequent basis, such as for remote control. I started using batteries more frequently since I have a ton of baby toys now and a lot of them require batteries.One thought that came to mind while I was writing this review is that I just wanted to share a quick and easy way to check if battery is dead or not. All you need to do is hold the battery over flat surface (let's say kitchen countertop) at one or so inches high and drop it vertically on the flatter side. If it drops and falls over it is dead. If it falls and stays vertical it is still good to go. A friend of mine told me this trick and it totally works!"

The box they came in was great and I love the no frills specialty that Amazon gives with these. There's no forced marketing on you to buy more of their batteries and the packaging was great. The price was fantastic for the 48 pack which would normally cost at least 5 - 10 more at a retail store for 24 batteries.Like I said, performance-wise these are great. I may order some of the rechargeable batteries in the future."

      "reviews.text": "I really wanted to love the Amazon AA batteries but they just are not durable enough for my usage. As a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 AA batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tester, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skip these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The 2nd light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tester shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours."

A bear attacked me. I grabbed my trusty sword, but it was out of batteries so it did not make the swoosh sounds that adds to the effect of my swing. So I hurriedly went to my trusty AmazonBasics AA batteries, and switched out the ones in my Power Rangers sword. My swooshing sounds were amazing, and I escaped with my life (not my leg but that's okay). Thank you AmazonBasics AA Batteries for saving a life."

I decided to hide these ones from the kids, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. So far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his xbox controller for days now and they are still going strong.

I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock."

In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long."

      "reviews.text": "I purchased plastic battery storage cases for the batteries I had been purchasing that came on a flat piece of cardboard covered by a plastic lid. When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaked inside my TV remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name brands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back. Amazon goes to great pains to see that its shipments come in containers that are easy for its customers to open and I appreciate that and am happy to see that they have carried that philosophy to include even small boxes containing their AmazonBasics Batteries. Good Job Amazon and thank you."

I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."

I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for wireless keyboards and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for AA batteries, but these happen to work quite well."

I have never been disappointed with anything to do with Amazon and I am absolutely sure these batteries will meet all my expectations. When I received them I immediately put them into a clock that needed them. I also put them into my milk frother and a few other devices. The clock is keeping perfect time and the other devices are working at full capacity. These will be used in my remote controls and any other thing that requires this size battery.

We then decided to try others, until we got a box of Duracell Procell AA 144 Batteries PC1500. They seemed to consistently last longer than the others. They were also usually 6 cents cheaper per battery. Undoubtedly, this was spelling: B-A-R-G-A-I-N! Actually, we remained with these, not even looking at alternatives until we kind of tripped over these AmazonBasics. Hands-down, these have been our best battery purchases.

At 0.34 (normally 0.43) cents a battery, not only are they comparable to 1 batteries (Usually 0.25-0.50 cents a battery), but they are much more heavyweight and they last a lot longer! Between the 4 of us, especially our 2 kids, we fly through batteries like water and when we find a discount brand we like, we hold on to them tightly! I will be purchasing more AmazonBasics AA Performance Alkaline Batteries especially with the Holidays coming. They are inexpensive, high quality and worth every penny!"

      "reviews.text": "The Amazon product line seems to have decent products. These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P"

I'll admit that Duracell are better in terms of performance and durability but they can be expensive sometimes. I feel like energizer are also a step above these but for the price, you can't go wrong. They do last long (depending on use) and seem like a better option compared to the cheap batteries found at gas stations of dollar stores. Great purchase overall."

      "reviews.text": "I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Barring that, enjoy!"

Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be powering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful.

      "reviews.text": "I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name."

Just don't charge them in a regular charger, it requires a special battery charger that specifically has alkaline support or it will explode."

The company became so successful at selling someone else's products, Amazon decided to start selling their own, thus Amazon Basics was born. Amazon Basic encompasses so many products, that are sold at such a reasonable price with excellent quality,that you should always look for Amazon Basics first.Recently, my Amazon Echo's remote, stopped working. I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information giver etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went. I realized I need to obtain a new supply of batteries, and entity Amazon's website. I found the Amazon Basics batteries,meets price and in a quantity of eight. I am now prepared for the holiday onslaught of battery needs. Just insert into your product and off you go.Recommended. prisrob 10-20-15"

In the past I would buy the cheap 4 packs of batteries from the 99cent store. They were decent, brand name and lasted about as long as the more expensive ones from a normal store. However, the 99cent store stopped selling the 4 packs and the 2 packs aren't worth the price and effort of making a special trip to a 99cent store. I bought a 16 pack of regular Duracell extra long life batteries at Target recently and went through those batteries just as fast as the 99cent store variety. Not okay.That's when I took to the internet. Good ol' Amazon has their own batteries for a much cheaper price What Perfect!I ordered a big ol' box of them and they truly do last as long as (or longer than) the name brand batteries I have purchased elsewhere but for a much better price.Now my nocturnal cats can play with their toys all night while I sleep and I can play Xbox until my fingers bleed, all for a better price. :D"

Overall I'd say it's a push between brand names and these based on cost per time they last. But they work fine.None of that is said with any kind of scientific testing. That's anecdotal based on how often I feel like I'm replacing batteries.The short version is that I'm happy with these and would buy them again.I got a pack of AAA's too and those work fine as well"

      "reviews.text": "Typically, I stick to Duracell so I was sceptical about 'Amazon brand' batteries. And buying them definitely gave my family more fuel to tease me about my alleged Anazon addiction. So far, they're working well. They're keeping the Wii Remote alive, which is vital to our Netflix usage. Plus, the price was amazing (8.49 for a 24 pack of AA, wow!) I'll update my review if this opinion changes.UPDATE: I bought these on June 10th, 2017. On that day, I replaced the Wii remote with 2 of the batteries. Today, which is July 12, 2017, they needed to be replaced. Subsequently, I can say that these lasted just a little over a month. Note that the remote is used a lot. Duracell batteries usually last almost 2 months, but since they cost over 2 times what these cost, I'm still overall happy with the Amazon brand."

I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustrating to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product.

I can get a good amount of use from these batteries. Of course it depends on how often and how long I use the devices but I don't notice a dramatic difference between these and higher end brand name batteries. For the price, I am happy with these. I have not had any leak and none so far have been duds. I am going with 4 stars. Not the best you can buy but certainly worth the price!"

Amazons prices for their batteries beats BJS by 5 to 6 depending on the size plus even at BJs you can't get a 48 pack of AA. The packaging was and simple which is fine because it does nothing for me. I must say that I like opening the package better with Amazon than normal batteries because I hate the thick plastic it's hard to cut and sometimes sharp, plus Amazons packaging is better for the environment.

Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell."

This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer."

But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries."
