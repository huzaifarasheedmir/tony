Other Thoughts: This product was recommended to me by a coworker and I was skeptical at first, but the product has turned out to be what I now rely on for most of my entertainment access."

      "reviews.text": "Pros: Allows you to cut your cable. With many apps to download and many apps that allow you free use of services such as streaming as long as you have a Cable provided (at least for the internet), you can log in and stream. You can use apps like Kodi and TubiTV to watch many shows. My favorite is TubiTV. Yes, there are commercials but not as many as other services.Buy this, check it out, enjoy your freedom from cable TV! Cons: Don't really have any complaints."

      "reviews.text": "Pros: I'm a subscriber to DirectTV Now! So i pay a yearly discount and get over 450+ channels streamed to my TV for 59 a month, I pay for Prime/Netflix. combined, My cable bill was 172.00 I get more choices options, and I got the components to run it off ethernet, so no lag.I have un-metered fiber optic, so I can stream a lot, given how my family is good at leaving it running. Cons: TV's in which HDMI ports don't extend out make this difficult to install, My 4K TV has side ports took me like 4 minutes. Wireless is pointless and get the ethernet addon"
