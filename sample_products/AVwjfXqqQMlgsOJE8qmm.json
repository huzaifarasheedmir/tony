I immediately thought of the fire kids edition and knew it would be good for him since it's still Android and since it's a very simple fix to get all of his favorite apps on it. A word of advice: Fire OS is very limited, but with a few downloads you can easily bypass the fire OS launcher and even install google services. Battery life is very good, and with the included case now I'm not afraid of another accidental drop. It can handle any of his kids games and with both the Amazon app store AND the play store the possibilities are endless."

Nothing works, change the address, change the credit card, try everything and nothing works. Finally I found a bypass method which is use my browser on my pc, connect to the amazon account and link the tablet, then I was able to install new apps.The second issue was to discover than the tablet can be only use on US, my surprise when I try to add more apps when I travel outside US and after hours of trying, found the answer on a forum when indicate than the tablet was created to be use on on US."

      "reviews.text": "We got this the day it came out. I have a four year old daughter, and she loves it! We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we can't get all of our apps/games on there because they're not available which is pretty disappointing.

      "reviews.text": "Bought this Kids Kindle at the Westland in a sealed box. Purchased this because of the 2 year warranty against anything and the 1 year access to Kindle software. It was purchased for a 2 year old. My daughter and her Marine husband were going to an Army base in Missouri the next day about a 12 hour drive. This Kindle has a SD slot so I wanted to load up a bunch of kids movies to keep him entertained on the trip, and then be able to get kids educational software later. The trip went fine and the Kindle worked great. Attached it to the headrest of the front seat with rubber bands. Unfortunately when they arrived in Mossouri and my daughter tried to register the Kindle, Amazon said it wasn't a Kids Kindle. I contacted the local Best Buy and explained the problem and they said it could be exchanged no problems. So the next week my daughter and her husband made the 75 mile drive from the Army base to Jefferson City the nearest Best Buy and made the exchange no hassles. While still in the store my daughter contacted Amazon and successfully registered the Kids Kindle. They've made several long road trips since and the access to kids movies on the SD chip have been a blessing. It's held up well to a 2 year olds handling and overall works very well. Great service from Best Buy."

So far this tablet works great it's way faster then the nabi was its easy for my 4 yr old to work and I can set time limits and what she can do it also shows me what she uses and for how long each day. The tablet is light and easy for her to hold and the bumper has worked good when it has been dropped. Has a great selection of free apps books and games for a full year after that its $4.99 a month. My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet"

She went from room to room showing her brothers what she could do with her tablet. Everybody wanted to do something with her tablet. As a parent, I just love the rubber bumper. The rubber bumper around the tablet is an excellent bonus to the tablet. It helps protect the tablet if it drops or falls accidentally. We all know how little hands sometimes drops things more than once. I only wish we could have bought this tablet much sooner. Being a first grader this year, my granddaughter can really benefit while using this tablet. Also, there are many educational opportunities for young children to engage themselves in instead of being glued to the television on a daily basis. This tablet is more child-centered and parental controlled."

Screen protectors would make the sensitivity too difficult for her to use and I couldn't ever find a good drop-proof protective case.I finally discovered the Amazon Fire Kids edition and wish I had known of this 3 broken tablets ago. Aside from the awesome drop-proof case, it has a nicely done custom kids view that removes all the things I don't want my daughter having access to (Youtube, the Google play store, web browsing). I already had one issue with it (99% certain it was my fault) but Amazon's \"Worry Free Guarantee\" had me a replacement tablet in 2 days for zero cost and no questions asked. If you have a young child you want to get a tablet for, this is it."

They absolutely love it and have become very adept at navigating everything (ridiculously easy for them which is a little scary). They've dropped it many times and the cushion on this thing has paid for itself already. Lots of kid-friendly apps - although it seems like you can only pick from their set list of apps - this might be an android/amazon thing I haven't figured out yet. My only complaint is it can be a little slow sometimes, particularly with downloading apps. Sometimes it shows the icon for an app like you have it, but then when they click it the wheels start spinning and it begins downloading, and it takes a couple of minutes (whereas my iPad would do it in about 15 sec). I don't mind the wait, but 3 yr olds get impatient quick. At least it's teaching them patience if not anything else. :)"
