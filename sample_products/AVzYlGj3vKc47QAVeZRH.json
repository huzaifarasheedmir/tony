The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."

      "reviews.text": "I bought the Fire HD 8 with 16MB ram on sale for $49.99 ($30 off sale and tax free day). My intent is to use it primarily to surf the internet while on the couch in front of the TV or in bed. If you've been using your cell phone to surf the internet at home this is a great solution for a more comfortable experience.Like others have stated, the Amazon Fire O/S is an Android flavor that Amazon modified and as such you can easily install the Google Playstore which allows you to download most of your favorite apps. You don't have to \"hack\" it to do this and installing the Google Playstore allows you to install the Chrome browser among other things. Basically, the Google apps and the Amazon Fire apps can coexist together so you don't have to remove any of the Amazon content or apps. Install Chrome, Gmail, Youtube, a nicer keyboard app and many Google apps as you like.Also, for those concerned that about the Amazon advertisements that show up ONLY ON THE LOCK SCREEN don't sweat it. No, you don't have to pay Amazon the extra $15 for an ad free lock screen. Simply call Amazon or open up a chat window with an Amazon rep and ask them to kindly remove the advertisements. It takes two minutes for them to do it remotely and apparently Amazon wants you to be a happy customer so they'll gladly do this for free.For $49.99 I'm very happy with the Amazon Fire HD 8. Lastly, I recommend the ZtoTop version of the case, the version with the built in handle that allows you to slide your hand in the backstrap to easily hold it without effort."

Easy to add Google Store (albeit without Amazon's support) so you may add Google apps such as PlayBooks, etc. So you're not really locked into Amazon's ecosystem. The lockscreen ads are only seen for a few moments after you press the standby button and then swipe; so you won't even be tempted to pay Amazon the extra $ to have them remove it (remotely). Very happy."

      "reviews.text": "Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."

Becuase the micro-sd card expands to 256 gig and the programs can be installed to the external drive...saving the valuable internal for the operating system. Samsung should do the same...if they did, I'd probably wouldn't have bought the Fire, but I'm so glad I did!! Love, love, love it!!"

They should have moved to usb-c. Other than that, great product for the price"

If you are looking for a full-featured tablet computer to use for content creation, serious research, or other work-related tasks, you should look at an iPad Pro. But if you are looking for a device for games, entertainment, casual reading, and consuming Amazon content, this device works great. If you're looking for something for your kids and don't want to shell out $350 or more for an iPad, I'd strongly recommend checking this Kindle Fire out.
