The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it.

Syncing with Amazon is seemless and easy to purchase through the website or loan through my local library. The battery is outstanding, and I haven't had to charge it yet! The built in dictionary is awesome for words you come across you don't know. Even upon completion of the book, all your highlighted words are compiled in a list to show how many and what new words you learned from this book!

I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. Love it!!"

I was able to order this online and \"pick up in store\" and it was very convenient because I was low on time. I highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an eReader. A few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go."

I love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever I go - just in case I get a chance to read. Like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere - you don't need wifi to read. Battery life is great. It has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. The down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. Also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. But I honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and I don't want anything that get's fancier than this."

Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that.
