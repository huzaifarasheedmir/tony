      "reviews.text": "This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings."

      "reviews.text": "The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops."

      "reviews.text": "The backpack is great quality. The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because I wouldn't trust the laptop slot alone to protect my laptop. It's not padded enough. If I had a choice I'd rather the laptop slot be replaced with a waterproof cooler space as I purchased this for hiking. That is my only gripe, other than that the bag is great quality, comfortable and has plenty of space. Well worth the price."

      "reviews.text": "PROS:Well made/good constructionCompares very favorably to famous brand-name packsNo obvious brandingGreat attention to detailLarge main compartmentLots of subcompartmentsOrganizer for pens/sundries in the front compartmentCONS:Generic looksTop handle is minimally padded/perfunctoryStiff nylon in some interior parts makes an audible 'crinkly' sound when movedThe AmazonBasics Laptop Backpack is a well-made, fully featured backpack that can accommodate laptops up to 17 inches wide. This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack."

      "reviews.text": "I ordered this backpack in anticipation of a 10-day vacation to Universal Studios and a Royal Caribbean cruise. I needed something to carry my laptop where I could easily remove it for security, and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things I needed to keep my 6yo busy.This AmazonBasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff. Whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and crinkly, but also easy to clean. There is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way, and when all the pockets are closed, there is an over abundance of zipper pulls. But the bag traveled very well and I like the sleeker style of it.The backpack is a bit much for everyday use (just in bulk and number of pockets, etc), but I'm happy to have it for future travels."

      "reviews.text": "I was expecting the backpack to be a little flimsy consider the price but it's great. The padding for my back and the laptop pocket is nice and thick. There is even a secondary pocket on the front of the laptop pouch that can fit my 8 tablet. Overall I really like it because it has so many pockets and little compartments. The only bad thing I can see about it is how they made it so cheap is that the material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy so it'll be easily punctured by pens and pencils and stuff. For me though that's no big deal because the outside of it is sturdy and will keep my stuff safe."

      "reviews.text": "This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone."

My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one."

      "reviews.text": "Even though this is classified as a laptop backpack, I'm really finding it much more useful as an all-purpose backpack. Of course, you could carry your laptop in it - there's a compartment specifically designed for one (17 or less) - but it's also comfortable and useful for general use.The backing is very sturdy. This sturdiness is designed to protect a laptop from tumbles and falls, but I love it for other reasons: First, I can throw all sorts of junk in this backpack (big books, a lunchbox, shoes, etc.) and nothing bulges from the back. This happens often with other backpacks, causing them to be difficult to carry, but the sturdy backing prevents this here. Second, it is quite comfortable. It's not a hard plastic backing, but just seems to be rigidly padded, and it almost feels like it's helping my posture when I wear it.My only complaint, and it isn't a big one, is that there are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. It can get a bit complicated remembering where something is, especially if you have a lot of stuff. This may just take a bit more getting used to, however, and it doesn't diminish the fact that this is a really great backpack. In fact I'd add that all this extra room inside the backpack is a bonus. Yes, I am really quite liking this backpack."

      "reviews.text": "I'm a lifelong backpack user, starting back after WW2 when my father outfitted us all with Army surplus items. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to hike we go. Or snowshoe. Oh, it was a different world then, and I'm not saying better. The equipment was heavy and prone to mildew if you weren't careful, as it was all made of natural fiber with metal fittings. And they hadn't yet heard of ergonomicsHere we have yet another AmazonBasics product that is a winner. An improved, contemporary version of that old military surplus that first accompanied us into the woods - I've followed a lifetime of upgrades. This is a nice big bag with lots of pockets and zippers. Like most of today's technical products, it is a tradeoff between total protection and portability. So no, you wouldn't throw this with your laptop inside and expect complete protection. But it is made of high quality nylon and other tekkie fabrics, has adequate padding and well shaped, comfortable pack straps, a handle on top where it belongs, and more straps, buckles and pockets here and there. I love straps, buckles and pockets.It can be expected to be water resistant, although for extended use in rain you would need a separate rain cover made of coated waterproof nylon. This backpack has a very pleasing look, mostly black with orange accents and is a nice conservative shape. And it is a very good value, which you will discover if you go shopping at the well-known places for this kind of thing."
