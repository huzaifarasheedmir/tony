The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."

It is so easy to use, the picture is amazing and the cost was considerably less what the Galaxy 7\" table cost with all the extras I added into mine. Came with 16GB storage which I quickly expanded to 64 and added a cover to protect it. So far, I love this tablet and am so glad I decided on this over the Galaxy 7\" tablet."

Very fast and reliable tablet. For the price, you will find no equal. I haven't even scratched the surface with everything that it can do. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the camera is only a 2mp resolution; which is surprising, considering they bothered to put a HD screen on the tablet."

Even so, I decided for this deal price to get him his own Kindle Fire, as well as the Fire case and a tempered glass screen protector. I got a 64gb micro sd and set it all up with his books and favorite news sites and apps he would use, and re boxed it up as a gift. Well 5 months have passed and he has not put it down! He loves it! He reads his books, surfs and has become a news hound. Suddenly we have all sorts of political discussions haha - good thing we are on the same page for the most part. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s great that he reads so much and has this as a hobby now that he is retired. What a fabulous gift this turned out to be. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s pretty easy for him to use even though he was used to Apple devices. He rarely has questions and just loves streaming video to the Chromecast, reading the news and has burned through a lot of novels. No complaints. I highly recommend this for the price, compared to my iPad that cost hundreds more."

Its 8\" display allows it to be quite portable while allowing the screen to be large enough for me to watch movies on it. The device has a Micro SD port on the side, which allows you to extend its internal memory. One slight disadvantage is that it runs on Fire OS 5, and although it is a variant of Android, you are limited to the apps available for download and installation through Amazon's Appstore as the Google Play Store app is not present on the tablet."

      "reviews.text": "Now, I didn't expect this to be an amazing tablet, but people were generally saying it was snappy enough. I wanted a media tablet. Something I could use late at night to watch YouTube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed. I also like it for online shopping so I don't have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen.PROS:Tablet exceeded my expectations. It's great for media. I use this more than my phone and my laptop now.It's snappy, I was able to complete my homework for online classes, watch videos from CNN and other tasks without too much struggleIt can be a general purpose tablet. HEED MY WARNING doing the following may void your warranty with Amazon, I'm not sure. But I installed the Google play store on my fire HD 8 and now have access to a huge selection of apps. I decided to do this after finding there was no good YouTube app from Amazon's app store. Because fire OS is basically Android with a heavy skin on it, everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures.SOUND IS FANTASTIC!!!! Did I say that loud enough? Yes they are still tablet speakers, no they won't fill your whole room with bumping bass but MY GOSH these are some GOOD tablet speakers. Better than my $900 smartphone, $1000 laptop and $500 iPad. What I'm trying to say is, the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest. Bravo Amazon.CONS:Ram is lacking. Doesn't excel in multitasking, drops tasks while you're away even if it was the last thing you were doing. It does this randomly however, and it's not always a problem. When it is it's very annoying.Screen is meh. It's good enough to not be a bother but coming from a 4k laptop and AMOLED display on my Google pixel XL, the screen is lacking. To the standard user, I don't think it will be noticeable though, and looks pretty good.Case and screen protector selection are sad and limited. Hopefully that changes soon as this tablet was just released this month.Cameras are useless. Not what I bought the tablet for so it didn't bother me one bit, but don't buy it for the cameras, a potato could take better photos.CONCLUSION:So overall I adore this tablet. I use it every day and now that I can have my Google apps and such on it, it is a fully functional Android tablet. It's wonderful, suits my needs, and hasn't disappointed me yet. Highly recommend."

I can read and listen to books PLUS a ton of other things (including browse on wifi). The \"offers\" show as lock screens and notifications and can be ignored or dismissed easily and make the device price of under $50 (during a promo) very reasonable! Speed is decent, storage upgradable with MicroSD, and feels like a book in a folio-style case. PERFECT! Note: I have other higher-end productivity tablet devices, also. This WILL NOT replace them or do all they can do. Entertainment, internet browsing and leisure is what this was purchased for and I'm pleased."

The last time I charged it my book library completely changed. I had the hardest time trying to find the book I had been reading.

For $80, can't hardly beat the features, but I was spoiled by arguably the best small Android tablet ever made. I knew the screen resolution was lacking, especially on an 8\" screen, but coming from the Nexus, it was a huge difference. Also, even at 4 plus years old, the processor was humming along smoothly. The extra .5 gb ram was also helpful. Anyways, back to the Fire HD 8. One advantage it had over the Nexus, was the expansion slot. I loved being able to put my media on it, but then again, the media displayed on the screen was subpar, so it's a wash. I installed Google play on it, so that it expanded its functionality, and I'm an avid Amazon conneseiur, but found the table too limiting. Ultimately returned and bought an old, discontinued Fire HD 6 for $20. The resolution almost matches that of the Nexus, so I'm happy for now."

It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box."

There's a YouTube video called \"$80 Tablet vs $800 Tablet Review\" that was the final straw in terms of convincing me. He dropped the tablet from a high distances onto a hard lamented floor, sometimes almost slamming it. The tablet was fine while the floor showed some damage. Perhaps there are some super demanding games that don't run well (I don't know I haven't checked), but for everything else it's does the job well enough."

The battery life is great. Very loud speakers to be a tablet. Its much different from an iPad or Android tablet, it took a little bit of exploring to fully figure everything out, and the settings are more limited but it works for what I need. The only con I've found so far is that the Appstore is more limited than Apple or Google Play but I haven't had a problem finding similar apps."

I really like the smaller size compared to my iPad Pro. By default, the display brightness was set to adjust automatically but I found this to make the screen too dark, especially for watching videos on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Fortunately, that is easily adjustable in the display settings. I know this drains the battery quicker but the battery still lasts several days with limited use. I paired a bluetooth keyboard to it just to try and it worked fine. The ads that appear when unlocking the screen really don't seem to be a bother.

This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4\" cell phone. If I could \"re-do\" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8."

I have them for my Paperwhite 2nd Gen and Fire HD 2012 - they are excellent. On/off and volume control buttons failed on one Fire HD 2012. The other 2012 works perfectly after six years. Paperwhite is fantastic.Note: Fire HD 10 32 GB with 1920 x 1200 and 1080 resolution offers much better viewing, but $150 is way too much. A current $80 discount for iPad 2017 makes Apple's entry model $249. I may try it.Bottom line: If it comes back to $59, the Fire HD 8 16 GB (2017) is a worthwhile purchase."

      "reviews.text": "I bought several of these for my grandkids after watching a video showing the tablet being tossed around and thrown forcibly onto the floor. During this video, the tablet was being abused but kept working without a problem. I hope my grandkids treat their tablets better than the guy in the video treated his but I believe the tablets are durable. The video guy wouldn't even consider throwing his more expensive other brand of tablet because he said he already knew it would break. I also ordered covers made of leather that will turn the tablets on when opened and off (sleep mode) when closed. I like the Alexa app and believe my grandkids will also. The tablet screen is large enough but not too large to handle. The processor is decent and although the operating version is a modified version of Android tailored for Amazon, it works fine. It is easy to use Kindle on this tablet and easy to find free or inexpensive books my grandkids will enjoy. The tablet price was great as well so I was able to give a nice gift to all six grandkids without breaking the bank! I hope the tablets I bought are as durable as the one demonstrated in the video."

You just have to be a little crafty. Follow the instructions here: http://saintlad.com/install-google-play-store-on-kindle-fire/ ...and in 15 minutes, I had the Play Store, Play Books (which means all of the books I had uploaded there now were available on the Kindle). Sure, you can use Amazon's servicesKindle books, videos, buying stuff on Amazonbut you don't -have- to. Note that this unit has the lockscreen ads which, frankly, you see only for 2 seconds before you unlock it; so don't waste your money thinking you have to pay more for the non-ad version.

      "reviews.text": "Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date."

The display is bright and sharp and response snappy. Available memory from the indicated 16 GB is around 10 GB after stock apps and operating system space allotted. For daily use that should be sufficient but downloaded content (not necessarily application) can be stored on a micro SD card (not included). All in all I'm very pleased with this purchase. Should my opinion change after Christmas, I'll let you know. ;)"
